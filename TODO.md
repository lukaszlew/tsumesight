# TODO

LL: Handle multiple variations through DFS and undo

LL: We need tooltips on everything that is unclear including all the buttons and move numbers on the tiles and the percentages etc. go through the whole UI. And suggest where we could put tooltips and how to make them more discoverable and overall how to teach the application in the learn by doing way.

LL: In order to submit liberties we should press a button that is on the group itself, but I don't know how to teach user that they should click the question mark. Let's brainstorm here.

LL: Font should be bigger on mobile it is somehow small at least on my my high resolution mobile.

LL: There should be no vibration on the long click.

LL: We shouldn't have to hold to see the liberties. It should be a toggle

LL: When we move back from the replay to the problem, we have lost the state of the last solution. The replay should be just temporary thing and that state should not be touched at all.

LL: There should be an option to hide a board so that the user can exercise from the beginning without interaction with the app. However, the second option is to require as a second phase re-entering the sequence, perhaps even it should be a first phase

LL: I should have somehow resolved sharing of the data between my phone, my local laptop, and my Chrome on laptop

LL: I should try to find some characteristics to classify the difficulty of the problem

LL: We should make sure the margins on the bored are as small as possible.

LL: Clicking time of all the liberties as long we should find ways to prune the amount of questions. We should again try asking which of the two groups have more liberties and this time clicking one of them on board

LL: We should be rotating the boards if they fit mobile better this way,

LL: There should be back button when the problem is solved

LL: When already answering the liberties just should be an option of seeing the sequence again. And not losing already answered questions.

LL: Perhaps there should be a button to try again after the problem is solved
