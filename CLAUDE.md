## User-visible text
All user-visible strings (tooltips, button labels, hint text, ARIA labels) must stay in sync with actual behavior. When changing a keyboard shortcut, renaming a feature, or modifying a flow, grep for the old text and update every occurrence. Tooltips should include the keyboard shortcut in parentheses when one exists.
